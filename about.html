  <p>My name is Julio Pagan and I'm a 2nd year student.</p>
  <p>I'm from Puerto Rico and arrived to Chicago 1 year ago and I enjoy great food as well as great music.</p>
  <p>If you want to listen to good elevator music this is what I recommend:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>I used to play video games, but not so much anymore.</li>
      <li>The challenge and motivation that comes with attempting to improve in video games is similar to the driving factor that leads one to pursuit ITM.</li>
      <li>Along the tech journey milestones further ignite this motivation</li>
  </ul>
